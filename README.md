# Advice Generator App

This project is a simple advice generator app built using the Advice Slip API to generate random quotes of advice. It's a great project for anyone learning how to interact with 3rd-party APIs and practicing web development skills.

## Project Overview

The challenge is to build out an advice generator app that allows users to view random advice quotes by clicking a dice icon. The app should display properly on different screen sizes and provide hover states for interactive elements.

## Features

- **Random Advice Generation:** Users can click the dice icon to generate a new piece of advice.
- **Responsive Design:** The app's layout adjusts according to the user's device screen size.
- **Interactive Elements:** Interactive elements have hover states to enhance user experience.

## Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout
- Mobile-first workflow
- Advice Slip API for random quote generation

## What I Learned

This project provided an opportunity to practice API integration with JavaScript. Despite some challenges with repetitive quotes due to caching, it was a valuable learning experience.
